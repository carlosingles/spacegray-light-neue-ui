# Spacegray Light Neue UI

Maintained port of the [Spacegray](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray) Light Sublime Text theme to Atom.

Note that this is not a _complete_ port, as I only coded the minimum amount of CSS to get the basic look and feel.

## Why Yet Another Port?

Because the other port ([spacegray-light-ui](https://atom.io/themes/spacegray-light-ui)) is unmaintained and out of date (last commit was in 2013).

I tried asking the author to take over the repo but [the issue](https://github.com/aesarius/spacegray-light-ui/issues/6) goes unanswered.
